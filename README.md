# FiraCode-hy
Fork of the FiraCode font with added ligatures for the hy programming language

## why?
I liked the idea of the vim-hy plugin, but i dont use vim. So i made it editor-agnostic!

ligature mapping:
```
(fn     -> (λ
(defn   -> (ƒ
(sum    -> (∑
(in     -> (∈
(not-in -> (∉
(and    -> (∧
(or     -> (∨
(not    -> (¬
(for    -> (∀
(None   -> (∅
(some   -> (∃
```
